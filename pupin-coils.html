	<p>Pupin's <em>1899 patent for loading coils</em>, archaically called <strong>"Pupin coils"</strong>, followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist <br>and mathematician <strong>Oliver Heaviside</strong>, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear <br>when the <em>American rights</em> to it were acquired by <strong>American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T)</strong>, making him wealthy.<br> Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led by <strong>George Campbell</strong> <br>and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which<br> was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
