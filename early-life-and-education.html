		<h1>Early life and education</h1>
		
		<h2>Early life</h2>
		
		<p><strong>Mihajlo Pupin was born on 9 October (27 September, OS) 1858 in the village of Idvor</strong> <em>(in the modern-day municipality <br>of Kovačica, Serbia) in Banat</em>, in the Military Frontier in the Austrian Empire. He always remembered the words of his <br>mother and cited her in his autobiography, From Immigrant to Inventor (1925):</p>
		
		<p><em>“My boy, If you wish to go out into the world about which you hear so much at the neighborhood gatherings, you must provide yourself with<br> another pair of eyes; the eyes of reading and writing. There is so much wonderful knowledge and learning in the world which you cannot get <br>unless you can read and write. Knowledge is the golden ladder over which we climb to heaven; knowledge is the light which illuminates our<br> path through this life and leads to a future life of everlasting glory.”</em></p>
		
		<p>Pupin went to elementary school in his birthplace, to <em>Serbian Orthodox school</em>, and later to <em>German elementary school in Perlez.</em><br>He enrolled in high school in <em>Pančevo</em>, and later in the <em>Real Gymnasium</em>. He was one of the best students there;<br> a local archpriest saw his enormous potential and talent, and influenced the authorities to give Pupin a scholarship.</p>
		
		<p>Because of his activity in the <strong>“Serbian Youth”</strong> movement, which at that time had many problems with Austro-Hungarian police authorities,<br> Pupin had to leave <b>Pančevo</b>. In 1872, he went to <b>Prague</b>, where he continued the sixth and first half of the seventh year. After his father died in<br> <em>March 1874</em>, the sixteen-year-old Pupin decided to cancel his education in Prague due to financial problems and to move to the <b>United States</b>.</p>
		
		<p><em>“When I landed at Castle Garden, forty-eight years ago, I had only five cents in my pocket. Had I brought five hundred dollars,<br> instead of five cents, my immediate career in the new, and to me perfectly strange, land would have been the same.<br> A young immigrant such as I was then does not begin his career until he has spent all the money which he has brought with him. I brought five cents,<br> and immediately spent it upon a piece of prune pie, which turned out to be a bogus prune pie. It contained nothing but pits of prunes.<br> If I had brought five hundred dollars, it would have taken me a little longer to spend it, mostly upon bogus things,<br> but the struggle which awaited me would have been the same in each case. It is no handicap to a boy immigrant to land here penniless; it is not a handicap<br> to any boy to be penniless when he strikes out for an independent career, provided that he has the stamina to stand the hardships that may be in store for him.”</em></p>
		
		<h3>Studies in America and Ph.D</h3>
		
		<p>For the next five years in the United States, Pupin worked as a <em>manual laborer (most notably at the biscuit factory on Cortlandt Street in Manhattan)</em> <br>while he learned English, Greek and Latin. He also gave private lectures. After three years of various courses, in the autumn of 1879<br> he successfully finished his tests and entered <em>Columbia College</em>, where he became known as an exceptional athlete and scholar. A friend of Pupin's predicted<br> that his physique would make him a splendid oarsman, and that <b>Columbia</b> would do anything for a good oarsman. A popular student,<br> he was elected president of his class in his Junior year. He graduated with honors in <em>1883</em> and became an American citizen at the same time.<p>
		
		<p>He obtained his Ph.D. at the <strong>University of Berlin</strong> under <em>Hermann von Helmholtz</em> and in 1889 he returned to Columbia University to become a lecturer<br> of mathematical physics in the newly formed <strong>Department of Electrical Engineering</strong>. Pupin's research pioneered carrier wave detection and current analysis.</p>
		
		<p>Pupin completed his studies in <em>1883</em> as one of the best students, especially in the field of <em>physics and mathematics</em>, which gave him a diploma. Later, he went back to <b>Europe</b>,<br>  initially the <em>United Kingdom (1883–1885)</em>, where he continued his schooling at the <em>University of Cambridge</em>. He was an early investigator<br> into X-ray imaging, but his claim to have made the first X-ray image in the United States is incorrect. He learned of <em>Röntgen's</em> discovery of unknown rays passing through wood<br>, paper, insulators, and thin metals leaving traces on a photographic plate, and attempted this himself. Using a vacuum tube, which he had previously used<br> to study the passage of electricity through rarefied gases, he made successful images on <em>January 2, 1896.</em> <strong>Edison</strong> provided Pupin with a <em>calcium tungstate fluoroscopic screen</em> which,<br> when placed in front of the film, shortened the exposure time by twenty times, from one hour to a few minutes. Based on the results of experiments,<br> Pupin concluded that the <em>impact of primary X-rays generated secondary X-rays</em>. With his work in the field of X-rays, Pupin gave a lecture at the <strong>New York Academy of Sciences.</strong><br> He was the first person to use a <em>fluorescent screen</em> to enhance X-rays for medical purposes. A New York surgeon, <b>Dr. Bull</b>, sent Pupin a patient to obtain an X-ray image<br> of his left hand prior to an operation to remove lead shot from a shotgun injury. The first attempt at imaging failed because the patient, a well-known lawyer,<br> was <em>"too weak and nervous to be stood still nearly an hour"</em> which is the time it took to get an X-ray photo at the time. In another attempt, the Edison fluorescent screen was placed on<br> a photographic plate and the patient's hand on the screen. X-rays passed through the patients hand and caused the screen to fluoresce, which then exposed the photographic plate. <br>A fairly good image was obtained with an exposure of only a few seconds and showed the shot as if <em>"drawn with pen and ink."</em> Dr. Bull was able to take out all of the lead balls in a very short time.</p>
